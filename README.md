# Local Paclet Server

This is my local paclet server. For a long time it lived on the Wolfram Cloud but ever since learning that the free tier of Wolfram Cloud web-hosting might disappear I decided to migrate it to GitHub.

GitHub is also just a materially better service so it's not much of a loss, either.
